WE have this text in the form: "Moving within Texas? Don't transfer blindly. Your current plan was priced for your old home, not your new one. Compare options"

I want to change "Compare Options" to "Learn More"

When users click "learn more" I want a pop up to generate. this is going to borrow heavily from the reference landing page. 

The pop should say Is Transferring Your Plan Really the Best Option? (it should have a caution icon like the refernece page)

Then have the text: Your current plan was designed for your old home's specific usage patterns. In your new home, everything changes—size, appliances, and your daily routine—which can make your old rate structure a poor fit.

Then in a yellow box (see reference page) Most people who transfer end up paying more than if they'd chosen a new plan optimized for their new home. It takes just 5 minutes to compare and know for sure which option will save you the most money.

At the bottom of that pop up/modal should be a zip code entry and a button that says {checkmark} Compare My Options. When the zip is entered and the button is clicked, it should take the user to https://orders.comparepower.com/?zip_code={zip_code}

Like the reference page, the modal should have a gray x to exit out of the modal. the modal should not disappear if the user clicks outside of it

Before building, please examine the reference page carefully. This was essentially already built. 

There are stat icons in the modal. I'd like to change them:


100+... plans to choose froom

16+... Providers competing for your business

5 Min... to compare options

1... best fit for your home
