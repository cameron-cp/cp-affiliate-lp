  needs.  

  if cp_afid is know, we popluate partner_name. if not, we say See why Texans trust Compare Power with their electricity shopping needs you will need to make color decisions according to wha tyou think will look best here

In the subheading below the hero message, we should bold the name of the partner (if known). 

and from the social proof we should remove $700M+
Saved for Texans and the $ icon. the remainijng words and icons should be re distributed in the container.
