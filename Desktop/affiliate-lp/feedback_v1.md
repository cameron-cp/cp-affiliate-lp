Feedback on v1 landing page:
when a user selects their home size, the compare power url it redirects to should include usage={usage_amount}. Usage amount should be 500 for small, 1000 for medium, 2000 for large, and 3000 for xl. so the url would look like https://orders.comparepower.com/?zip_code=75238&usage=500 for a small home in 75238
The hero message should be changed from "Save Money on Your Electricity Bill" to "Pay as little as possible for your new electricity plan." "as little as possible should be bold.
The subheading should read "Compare plans from top competing energy providers
and get the best one instantly. Trusted by millions of
happy Texans. Trusted by {{ partner_name }}." 
In the subheading, "Trusted by {{partner_name}} should only be populated if the cp_afid in the URL is populated and the affiliate_name is known
Above the hero message should be an all caps message that says "MILLIONS (YES, MILLIONS) OF HAPPY CUSTOMERS"

--Form feedback--
On the form button, "Compare Rates Now" should be "Find My Plan." The button should be the brand orange and the text should be bold
Remove "get your free quote" and replace with "Get Power in Minutes" and "Enter your details below to compare rates instantly"
The form should be below the subheading (all aligned left) and only include: home size text "My home is a:" and drop down, zip code text and input area, button and beneath that button it should say "in minutes"
You can remove this: "By clicking "Compare Rates Now", you agree to receive calls and texts from Compare Power and its partners."
