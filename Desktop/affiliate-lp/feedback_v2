Feedback to the hero section after we borrowed from the reference landijng page:

in "Pay as little as possible for your electricity plan," the "as little as possible" should be the yellowed text. the rest should be white. 

I like how in the reference here secion the header with "Get power in mijnutes" us a slightly differnt color than the white box the form is in. I would like to see that here.

the home size buttons should still include square footage in them

the button to submit the form is currently white - it should be brand orange. I also like have an arrow after find my plan

you can remove "in minutes"

I like the two little call outs under the button on the reference page:

Same-Day Connection Available
Orders placed before 5PM (Mon-Sat) can get connected today!

Moving within Texas? Don't transfer blindly. Your current plan was priced for your old home, not your new one. Compare options

I would like to steal those - colors, icons, design, etc.
